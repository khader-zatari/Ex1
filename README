Exercise 1 - Generic Hash Table

===Description ===

Program files:
files:GenericHashTable.c - file that implementaion a Linked list and its Actions.

funcation:
	createTable - creating table with it's and updating it's properities, the inputs for the function is the "size" and it's the original column number in the table, "dType" it's the type of the table if it's a table for integars or table for strings,and "listLength" it's the number of the rows(the capacity of the objects'nods' in each column)of the table and they are unchangable. and it returns a pointer of the table.
	createObject - it creats an object and put the data in it and it returns a pointer to this object
	printTable - it prints the table in this formate [i]    x   --> . 'i': it's the index of the column in the table. and 'x' is a number or a string
	intHashFun - it returns the hash value in the table and the formula is key %size which key is the number that we want to add to the table, and the size is the original size of the table 
	strHashFun - it returns the hash value in the table.and it takes a string the value is based on the asccii value of each charachter it sum them. and make the mod size to them which size is the original size of the table 
	isEqual - it compares the value of two data and if it's idintical it returns 0  else where it returns -1
    search - it search for a spesific data in the table and it returns a pointer of the object that contains that data value 
    add -it add's the data 'string or intiger' to the table in a right way and if the table needs to be doubled it double it then it rearange the data in a propriet way then ad the data after doubling it. 
    removeObj -it remove the object that contains the given data and it considers the linked list properities 
    freeObject - make free to the object 
    freeTable -it frees the table and it's all allocated memory fields.
